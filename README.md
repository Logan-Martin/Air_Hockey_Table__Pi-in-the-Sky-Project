## Progress

### Week of 1-2-2023
#### CAD
This week I adjusted the pillars on the sides up 3mm in order to account for the socket heads of the screws. I also added some basic walls.



### Week of 1-9-2023
#### CAD
This week I confirmed the model for the middle supports of the fans and also added a base for the air hockey table and receptacles for the pucks. Most things are getting 3-D printed over the weekend. Next week will be basic assembly of the pillars and fans in order to figure out how to apply the circuit board and other electronics.
